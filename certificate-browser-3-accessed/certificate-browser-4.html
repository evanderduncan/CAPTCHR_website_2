            Last year, Google's attempts to verify my humanity started to feel increasingly aggressive. 
            The simple "I'm not a robot" button was soon followed by demands to select traffic lights, 
            crosswalks, and storefronts from an image grid. However, the traffic lights were often hidden 
            in foliage, the crosswalks were warped and half around corners, and the storefront signs were 
            blurry and written in Korean. Trying to identify a fire hydrant felt dispiriting, and it became 
            clear that the CAPTCHA tool was no longer an effective method for distinguishing between humans 
            and machines.
            <br><br>
            While CAPTCHA was once an elegant tool for training AI, it has become increasingly outdated in 
            the face of synthetic media. Computers are now almost as good as humans at basic text, image, 
            voice, and face recognition tasks. Synthetic media refers to content made entirely or partially 
            by computers that mimics human behavior or work, making it impossible for CAPTCHA to differentiate 
            between humans and computers.
            <br><br>
            Enter CAPTCHR: a new form of CAPTCHA that embraces synthetic media rather than attempting to fight 
            against it. CAPTCHR utilises a range of models, including voice and face recognition and sentiment 
            tests, to differentiate between humans and machines. However, while this may seem like a step forward, 
            there are some concerns that this new form of CAPTCHA could actually be making things harder for humans.
            <br><br>
            For starters, the new models used by CAPTCHR are likely to be difficult for some people to pass. For 
            example, those with speech impediments may struggle with the voice recognition test, while those who 
            are visually impaired may struggle with the image-based tests. Additionally, as synthetic media 
            continues to develop, it's possible that even these new models will become outdated in the not-too-
            distant future.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, there are concerns that CAPTCHR, like many other technological advancements, prioritises 
            data collection over making things easy for humans. By using synthetic media to train its models, 
            CAPTCHR is essentially collecting data on how humans behave online, which could be used for a range 
            of purposes, some of which may not be in the best interests of the users themselves.
            <br><br>
            In a small step on the journey of artificial intelligence, CAPTCHR may seem like a move in the right 
            direction in the fight to define humanity, there are still some concerns about its efficacy and 
            potential downsides. As with any technological advancement, it's important to weigh the benefits 
            against the risks before adopting it wholesale.
            <br><br>
            Unfortunately, we have.
