              Hey there, fellow netizens, let's dive into a topic that has been causing quite a buzz 
              in the world of internet security: CAPTCHR. It's the new and improved captcha that not 
              only tests if you're human or not but assigns you a "human certificate". Sounds good, 
              right? Wrong.
           <br><br>
            The idea of a "human certificate" might seem harmless at first, but it's actually quite 
            concerning. Think about it, who decides who is "human enough" to access certain websites? 
            A private company, that's who. This is eerily similar to how fascist governments and other 
            regimes have used identity documents to control and discriminate against certain groups of 
            people.
           <br><br>
            The concept of a "human certificate" raises questions about the fairness of access to 
            information on the internet. It creates a system of privilege and exclusion, where those
             who are deemed "human enough" get to access certain websites, while others are locked out. 
             This goes against the very principles of a free and open internet, which should be accessible 
             to everyone regardless of their background.
            <br><br>
            CAPTCHA was pretty frustrating for most but particularly people with disabilities such as 
            visual impairment. CAPTCHR is even worse! Now we have a situation in which not only is it 
            impossible for certain disabled people to access websites, they now get denied a “human 
            certificate” - whatever that is? By introducing a human certificate, the evil company behind 
            CAPTCHR has deemed people unable to complete their CAPTCHRs unhuman.
            <br><br>
            On TOP of that, the use of a "human certificate" will open the door to discrimination against other groups 
            of people, based on factors such as race, gender, or socio-economic status. This company can 
            choose arbitrary criteria for determining who is "human enough" and can be biassed towards any 
            certain group of people - who's holding them to account??
            <br><br>
            As users of the internet, we must be vigilant and speak out against any attempts to use digital 
            certificates as a means of control and exclusion. Instead, we should advocate for a more equitable 
            and democratic internet where everyone has equal access to information and resources.
            <br><br>
            Ultimately, CAPTCHR might seem like a harmless upgrade to the traditional captcha to keep up with 
            whatever synthetic media chucks out, but the concept of a "human certificate" is deeply concerning.
            It raises questions about fairness, access, and discrimination. Let's stand up for our right to a 
            free and open internet, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect.
            <br><br>
            F*!k CAPTCHR,
