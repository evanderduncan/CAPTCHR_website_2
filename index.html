            <p>Welcome to CAPTCHR</p> <br>
            A speculative Net.Art experience that uses the CAPTCHA interaction 
            to explore the boundary between human and computer.<br><br>
            CAPTCHAs require humans to prove that they're not robots by passing 
            tests designed to be impossible for computers.<br><br>
            
            As computers gain more human-like capabilities, what kind of data 
            will be captured and measured to distinguish humans from computers.<br><br>
            
            CAPTCHR is a piece of intervention service design. Bringing 
            awareness to the increasingly invasive and demeaning forms of human validation 
            that we will be subjected to in the future.
